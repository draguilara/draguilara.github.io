[This course](https://www.unitec.edu/estudios/pregrado/mecatronica) focuses on Industrial Networksâ€”specialized communication systems used in automated industries. It examines how these networks enable the integration of control devices (such as PLCs) with various sensors and actuators, allowing for efficient monitoring and control through SCADA systems and HMI interfaces.
