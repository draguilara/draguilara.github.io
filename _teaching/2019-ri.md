[This course](https://www.unitec.edu/estudios/pregrado/mecatronica) covers the study of Industrial Networks, a special type of communication network used in automated industries. These networks allow the integration of control devices (PLC Automation) and different sensors and actuators, to be monitored and controlled by means of SCADA systems and HMI interfaces.
