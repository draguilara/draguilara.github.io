I'm Diego Aguilar, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Fulbright Alumnus at <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE" target="_blank"> Purdue University</a> working under the advisorship of <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~dionysis/" target="_blank"> Dr. Dionysios Aliprantis</a>. My work focuses on 3D FEA for electric machines, particularly EVs. I also research about optimization for power systems and renewable energies. <br> <br>

Before jumping to academia, I was a Senior Engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/conersa/" target="_blank"> CONERSA </a> for 5 years, where I worked in large scale industrial automation, power grids and electric machinery projects across several industries. I also lectured courses on PLC and industrial networks at my alma mater. I did my MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University with <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=173054&group_id=277631" target="_blank"> Dr. Luciano Castillo</a> (2024) and my BSc in Mechatronics Engineering at <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE](https://www.unitec.edu/)" target="_blank"> Universidad Tecnológica Centroamericana</a> (2017).
