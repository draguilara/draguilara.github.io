Highlights:
- Novel rolling horizon strategy optimally splits time horizon for cost and accuracy
- Probabilistic forecasts enable robust RES MG scheduling under uncertainty
- RES variability leads to trade-off between prediction accuracy and dispatch costs.
- Solar forecasts allow longer, cheaper schedules despite lower power output.
